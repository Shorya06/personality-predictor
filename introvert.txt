I enjoy spending quiet evenings at home, reading books and reflecting on my thoughts. Large social gatherings can be overwhelming, and I prefer deep conversations with a few close friends.

Solitude gives me energy and helps me process my emotions. I often find myself journaling or taking long walks in nature, appreciating the peace and quiet. My favorite weekends are those spent curled up with a novel or exploring creative hobbies like painting or writing poetry.

While I value meaningful relationships, I need time alone to recharge. I am introspective and thoughtful, always considering different perspectives before making decisions. I believe that self-awareness and personal growth are lifelong journeys.

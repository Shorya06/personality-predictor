I often feel anxious about the future and worry about things that might go wrong. Even small problems can make me feel stressed, but I try to manage my emotions as best as I can.

Sometimes, I find myself overthinking situations or replaying conversations in my mind, wondering if I said the right thing. When faced with uncertainty, I can become restless or irritable, but I am learning to practice mindfulness and self-care to cope with these feelings.

Despite my worries, I am empathetic and sensitive to the emotions of others. I value support from friends and family, and I am working on building resilience and confidence in myself.
